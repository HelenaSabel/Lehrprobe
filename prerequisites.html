					<h3>Textual criticism: terminology and principles</h3>
					<p>In the words of <a href="bibliography.html#Shillingsburg1996">Shillingsburg
							(1996: 4)</a>:</p>
					<blockquote>Textual criticism is often understood as the art of examining
						literary texts to authenticate the words, their order, spelling,
						punctuation, and capitalization. Authenticated texts are generally thought
						to be reliable for reading and studying literary works. Thus, textual
						critics are valued because they serve the laudable function of providing
						authenticated texts.</blockquote>
					<p>To complete Shillingsburg description, we may add that the need to provide an
						“authenticated text” is also part of Diplomatics, thus the methods used
						within textual criticism are also applicable to non-literary documents.</p>
					<h4>The critical method: principles</h4>
					<p>Through specific techniques, textual criticism investigates the genesis and
						evolution of a work, identifying its various forms and its transformations
						over time (<a href="bibliography.html#Chiesa2002">Chiesa 2002</a>: 11).
						Traditionally, these techniques are divided into two distinct phases: the
								<em><strong>recensio</strong></em>, in which the witnesses of a text
						are evaluated, and the <em><strong>constitutio textus</strong></em>, which
						consists on providing the authenticated text, “a hypothesis of a text
						conforming to what the orginal should have been on the basis of the results
						of the <em>recensio</em>” (<a href="bibliography.html#Chiesa2002">Chiesa
							2002</a>: 51-52, emphasis and translation mine).</p>
					<h5>
						<em>Recensio</em>
					</h5>
					<p>The first step is the compilation of sources relating to a text (tradition).
						The tradition may be of two types:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>direct tradition</strong>: manuscripts (or printed)</li>
						<li><strong>indirect tradition</strong>: comments, quotations, translations,
							imitations... </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Depending on the number of preserved witnesses, the paths of the editor are
						diversified. A distinction must be made between: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>traditions with a single witness (<em>codex unicus</em>). The work is
							transcribed, which undergoes a process of <em>examinatio</em>, i.e. word
							division, resolution of abbreviations, punctuation, correction of
							mechanical errors, <em>emendatio</em>. </li>
						<li>tradition with several witnesses. The relationships between the
							witnesses must be established. A <em>e<strong></strong></em> will be
							carried out to establish the <em>variae lectiones</em> or variants.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The editor must the variants collected during the <em>collatio</em>, and
						select the <em><strong>loci critici</strong></em> that will allow her/him to
						classify the witnesses.</p>
					<p> The only clue is to let oneself be guided by the <strong>obvious
							errors</strong>, considering a series of principles:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>any deviation from the original constitutes an <strong>error</strong>
							–involuntary mistakes made by the copyist during the copying process– or
							an innovation –the copyist consciously varies the lesson of his model–; </li>
						<li>errors and innovations constitute an irrefutable proof to relate the
							different witnesses of a work. Its presence marks the sources derived
							from the manuscript in which the error or innovation occurred, allowing
							the grouping into families; </li>
						<li>there are two main types of variants: <strong>equipolent
								readings</strong>, all readings are correct in principle, and
								<strong>errors</strong> (opoposed to correct readings). If one or
							more witnesses read independently from others, they have
									<em><strong>lectiones singulares</strong></em> (equipolent
							readings or errors); </li>
						<li>equipolent readings do not allow us to affiliate the witnesses; they
							must be used to corroborate filiations. The affiliation is done based on
							the errors; </li>
						<li>a singular lesson may be the authentic one against the lesson of the
							other witnesses. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>As said above, the only valid criterion for affiliation is the
							<strong>significant common error</strong>. There are two types:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>common conjunctive errors</strong>. They are found in two or
							more witnesses; they could not have been committed by the copyists
							independently. They are a guarantee of connection between the copies
							that have them; </li>
						<li><strong>common separative errors</strong>. They are those which a
							copyist cannot notice or correct by conjecture or other witnesses. Its
							presence in one witnesses and its absence in others indicates
							independence of the former with respect to the latter. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>The correct classification of errors is fundamental in an edition:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>omissions due to eye-skipping, transpositions and equipolent readings
							are not significant; </li>
						<li>gaps not derived from a <em>homeoteleuton</em> and repetitions of a word
							prefixed or postponed by addition, apart from in its place, in another
							place, are decisive. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Significant errors can eventually prove:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the independence of a witness with respect to others;</li>
						<li>the connection of two or more witnesses against another;</li>
						<li>the descent of all the witnesses from a common ancestor other than the
							original. </li>
					</ul>
					<p> After the examination of the variants, the <em><strong>stemma
								codicum</strong></em> is drawn, which formalises the relationships
						between the copies that preserve a text. </p>
					<p>The <em>stemma</em> includes the <em>codices descripti</em> (and
						contamination). These are only removed in the <em>constitutio textus</em>
						stage. </p>
					<p><strong>What is represented on a stemma?</strong>: families or groups of
						witnesses (see Fig. 1 with an example). </p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Family</strong>: set of witnesses characterized by the presence
							of common conjunctive errors, which depend on a common branch, an
								<strong>ascendant</strong> (archetype or subarchetype). The
							association of the codices is corroborated by the presence of readings
							that are characteristic of each family; </li>
						<li><strong>Ascendant</strong>: name given to the manuscript on which
							depends a group of witnesses that make up a family, or the totality of
							the witnesses of a work. </li>
					</ul>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/stemma.png" />
						<figcaption>Fig. 1. Example of a stemma (the most accepted stemma hypothesis
							for the booksongs preserving the Galician-Portuguese secular
							lyric</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Consider:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If the ascendant is preserved, the derived copies have no stemmatic
							value: these are the <em>codices descripti</em>; they are removed from
							the <em>stemma</em> (<em>eliminatio codicum descriptorum</em>). </li>
						<li>If the ascendant has been lost, it is called <em><strong>codex
									interpositus</strong></em>. It is reconstructed through the
							comparative analysis of the characteristic variants of the family of
							preserved manuscripts. When this codex represents the antecedent of only
							one family of witnesses it is called a <strong>subarchetype</strong>.
							When it is the antecedent of all preserved manuscripts it is called an
								<strong>archetype</strong> (i.e. original). The existence of an
							archetype is demonstrable when all witnesses offer at least one common
							conjunctive error. </li>
					</ul>
					<h3>
						<em>Constitutio textus</em>
					</h3>
					<p>After the <em>recensio</em> phase, the editor can face two possible
						situations:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>s/he was able to affiliate all the witnesses and draw a <em>stemma
								codicum</em>; </li>
						<li>s/he could not determine the relationships –or only some– between the
							witnesses, and thus the <em>stemma</em> could not be drawn.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In both cases, the variants will be examined and selected, operating in each
						case in a particular way.</p>
					<p>At the stage of the <em><strong>constitutio textus</strong></em>, the
						archetype cannot be a preserved codex. If preserved, the other witnesses
						will be <em><strong>codices descripti</strong></em>, the stemma thus
						disappears when reduced to a <em><strong>codex unicus</strong></em>. The
						archetype must be understood as a lost, specific codex that we can
						reconstruct from the preserved witnesses. </p>
					<p>The reconstruction of the archetype cannot be done in a completely mechanical
						way: the reading determined by the <em>stemma</em> would be erroneously
						accepted in all cases. </p>
					<p>At this stage the <em><strong>iudicium</strong></em> must intervene: it will
						be necessary to choose between the equipolent variants of the
							<em>recensio</em>. The editor makes use of internal data that allows her
						or him to privilege one reading over another: this is a
								<em><strong>examinatio cum iudicio</strong></em>.</p>
					<p> The editor must analyse each of the <em><strong>loci critici</strong></em>.
						The <em>stemma</em> must serve to corroborate the selection of the variant,
						which must be done, above all, based on a complete knowledge of the
								<em><strong>usus scribendi</strong></em> of the author and her or
						his time. </p>
					<p>However, at times the editor might need to resolve a locus criticus with a
						particular solution that it is not based on the readings of the manuscripts:
						this is called <em><strong>emendatio ope ingenii</strong></em> in which the
						interpretation of the editor plays a key role. The
								<strong><em>emendatio</em></strong> must be done attending to
						different criteria:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<em>
								<strong>lectio difficilior probior</strong>
							</em> (prefer the more difficult reading) </li>
						<li>
							<em>
								<strong>lectio brevior potior</strong>
							</em> (favor the briefer reading) </li>
						<li>
							<em>
								<strong>usus scribendi</strong>
							</em> (editors should be sensitive to norms and habits that are typical
							of times or places or schools of writing) </li>
						<li>
							<em>
								<strong>conformatio textus</strong>
							</em> (the context: the editor evaluates the lost or addition of
							particules (e.g. negations, clitics, etc.), a frequent phenomenon during
							the process of copying a witness) </li>
						<li>
							<em>
								<strong>res metrica</strong>
							</em> (when the work is in verse, the editor evaluates cases of
							hypometry and hypermetry) </li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Overview of the steps</h4>
					<p>The following flashcards present the main steps of <strong>stemmatic textual
							criticsm</strong> based on the manual by Paul Maas: <em>Textkritik</em>
							(<a href="bibliography.html#Maas1957">1957<sup>3</sup> [1927]</a>). You
						can use the flashcards both to test your knowledge and to learn any new
						terms.</p>

					<h3>Textology and editions</h3>
					<p>The previous section focused on a particular editing method. However,
						depending on the type of edition to be published, an editor might implement
						a different methodology (that may or may not include some of the described
						steps). The following flashcards present the most common types of editions
						(originally conceived for the printed medium).</p>
