					<h3>Textual criticism: terminology and principles</h3>
					<p>In the words of <a href="bibliography.html#Shillingsburg1996">Shillingsburg
							(1996: 4)</a>:</p>
					<blockquote>Textual criticism is often understood as the art of examining
						literary texts to authenticate the words, their order, spelling,
						punctuation, and capitalization. Authenticated texts are generally thought
						to be reliable for reading and studying literary works. Thus, textual
						critics are valued because they serve the laudable function of providing
						authenticated texts.</blockquote>
					<p>To complete Shillingsburg description, it is necessary to add that the need
						to provide an “authenticated text” is also part of Diplomatics so the
						methods used within textual criticism are applicable to non-literary
						documents.</p>
					<h4>The critical method: principles</h4>
					<p>Through specific techniques, textual criticism investigates the genesis and
						evolution of a work, identifying its various forms and its transformations
						over time (<a href="bibliography.html#Chiesa2002">Chiesa 2002</a>: 11).
						Traditionally, these techniques are divided into two distinct phases: the
							<em>recensio</em>, in which the witnesses of a text are evaluated, and
						the <em>constitutio textus</em>, which consists on providing the
						authenticated text, “a hypothesis of a text conforming to what the orginal
						should have been on the basis of the results of the <em>recensio</em>” (<a
							href="bibliography.html#Chiesa2002">Chiesa 2002</a>: 51-52, my
						translation).</p>
					<p>The first step is the compilation of sources relating to a text (tradition).
						The tradition may be of two types:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>direct tradition</strong>: manuscripts (or printed)</li>
						<li><strong>indirect tradition</strong>: comments, quotations, translations,
							imitations... </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Depending on the number of saved witnesses preserved, the paths of the editor
						are diversified. A distinction must be made between: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>traditions with a single witness (<em>codex unicus</em>). The work is
							transcribed, which undergoes a process of <em>examinatio</em>, i.e. word
							division, resolution of abbreviations, punctuation, correction of
							mechanical errors, <em>emendatio</em>. </li>
						<li>tradition with several witnesses. The relationships between the
							witnesses must be established. A <em>collatio</em> will be carried out
							to establish the <em>variae lectiones</em> or variants.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The editor must the variants collected during the <em>collatio</em>, and
						select the <em><strong>loci critici</strong></em> that will allow her/him to
						classify the witnesses.</p>
					<p> The only clue is to let oneself be guided by the <strong>obvious
							errors</strong>, considering a series of principles:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>any deviation from the original constitutes an <strong>error</strong>
							–involuntary mistakes made by the copyist during the copying process– or
							an innovation –the copyist consciously varies the lesson of his model–; </li>
						<li>errors and innovations constitute an irrefutable proof to relate the
							different witnesses of a work. Its presence marks the sources derived
							from the manuscript in which the error or innovation occurred, allowing
							the grouping into families; </li>
						<li>there are two main types of variants: <strong>equipolent
								readings</strong>, all readings are correct in principle, and
								<strong>errors</strong> (opoposed to correct readings). If one or
							more witnesses read independently from others, they have
									<em><strong>lectiones singulares</strong></em> (equipolent
							readings or errors); </li>
						<li>equipolent readings do not allow us to affiliate the witnesses; they
							must be used to corroborate filiations. The affiliation is done based on
							the errors; </li>
						<li>a singular lesson may be the authentic one against the lesson of the
							other witnesses. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>As said above, the only valid criterion for affiliation is the
							<strong>significant common error</strong>. There are two types:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>common conjunctive errors</strong>. They are found in two or
							more witnesses; they could not have been committed by the copyists
							independently. They are a guarantee of connection between the copies
							that have them; </li>
						<li><strong>common separative errors</strong>. They are those which a
							copyist cannot notice or correct by conjecture or other witnesses. Its
							presence in one witnesses and its absence in others indicates
							independence of the former with respect to the latter. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>The correct classification of errors is fundamental in an edition:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>omissions due to eye-skipping, transpositions and equipolent readings
							are not significant; </li>
						<li>gaps not derived from a <em>homeoteleuton</em> and repetitions of a word
							prefixed or postponed by addition, apart from in its place, in another
							place, are decisive. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Significant errors can eventually prove:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the independence of a witness with respect to others;</li>
						<li>the connection of two or more witnesses against another;</li>
						<li>the descent of all the witnesses from a common ancestor other than the
							original. </li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Overview of the steps</h4>
					<p>The following flashcards present the main steps of <strong>stemmatic textual
							criticsm</strong> based on the manual by Paul Maas: <em>Textkritik</em>
							(<a href="bibliography.html#Maas1957">1957<sup>3</sup> [1927]</a>). You
						can use the flashcards both to test your knowledge and to learn any new
						terms.</p>
